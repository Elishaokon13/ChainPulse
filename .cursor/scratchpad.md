# Planner/Executor Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to restyle the entire application to be sleek and responsive across all devices using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Integrating Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI into the existing project structure.
2. Identifying all existing UI components and determining which ones need to be replaced or refactyled using Shadcn UI or Tailwind CSS classes.
3. Ensuring responsiveness across a variety of devices and screen sizes.
4. Potentially refactoring existing CSS or styling solutions to avoid conflicts.

## High-level Task Breakdown

- [x] Task 1: Set up Tailwind CSS in the project.
    - [x] 1.1: Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

Executor has confirmed Tailwind CSS is set up via Vite after initial difficulty locating standard config files. The task of generating config files is marked as complete/not applicable in the standard sense. Proceeding to configure template paths.

Executor has completed generating `tailwind.config.js` and configuring template paths. Proceeding to add Tailwind directives to the main CSS file.

Executor has confirmed Tailwind directives are already present. Ready to begin Shadcn UI integration.

Attempting to initialize Shadcn UI. Found that `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` is deprecated. Will use `npx shadcn@latest init` instead.

Executor has configured the import alias required for Shadcn UI CLI by creating/editing tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, and vite.config.js. Ready to re-attempt Shadcn UI initialization.

Executor has completed Shadcn UI initialization. Ready to add the recommended base CSS styles.

Executor has completed scanning the codebase and identified key Material-UI components for restyling or replacement with Shadcn UI/Tailwind CSS.

Executor is now manually inspecting files in `src/components/` to find Material-UI Button usage, starting with `LoadingState.jsx`. Checked `LoadingState.jsx` and found no Material-UI Button usage.

Attempting to replace Material-UI Button and IconButton components in `src/pages/Api.jsx`. Successfully replaced the Material-UI Button for the API key.

Attempted to run `npm run dev` in the background. Waiting for user feedback on terminal output and server status regarding the persistent `border-border` error.

Development server is running successfully despite the `border-border` warning. Skipping the previously blocked edit in `src/pages/Api.jsx` for now. Moving to `src/pages/ProjectDetails.jsx` to continue replacing Material-UI buttons.

Starting replacement of Material-UI Buttons and IconButtons with Shadcn UI Button in `src/pages/ProjectDetails.jsx`. Beginning with the "Back to Dashboard" button.

Updated `tailwind.config.js` with Shadcn UI color configuration.

New User Request: Full codebase review and proper setup of a "Grotesk" font.

**Current Status for Grotesk Font Task:** Set Grotesk as the default font for the application by adding `font-grotesk` class to the body in `src/App.css`. **Identified that the font was not being loaded in `index.html` and added a link tag to load Space Grotesk from Google Fonts.**

New Blocking Issue: `[plugin:@tailwindcss/vite:generate:serve] Cannot apply unknown utility class \`border-border\`` persists after updating `tailwind.config.js`.

Investigation: Verified `--border` CSS variable exists in `src/index.css`. Examined and updated `tailwind.config.js` with Shadcn UI color mapping.

Plan: Perform a clean reinstall of dependencies by deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then running `npm install`.

New Blocking Issue: Persistent `[plugin:@tailwindcss/vite:generate:serve] Cannot apply unknown utility class \`border-border\`` and `bg-background` errors due to incorrect @apply syntax in `src/index.css`.

Investigation: Identified incorrect `@apply` syntax in `src/index.css`.

Plan: Correct the `@apply` syntax in `src/index.css`.

Corrected `@apply` syntax in `src/index.css`. Attempting to run `npm run dev` again to verify the fix.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Resolved issue with locating Tailwind setup by performing a codebase search and identifying Vite integration. The previous `npx` error was likely due to the standard init command not being suitable for this setup.

Ready to run `npx shadcn@latest init` to initialize Shadcn UI. This will be an interactive process requiring user input.

Executor has completed Shadcn UI initialization. Ready to add the recommended base CSS styles.

Executor has completed scanning the codebase and identified key Material-UI components for restyling or replacement with Shadcn UI/Tailwind CSS.

A segmentation fault occurred when running `yarn`. Attempting to resolve by deleting `node_modules` and `yarn.lock`, then running `npm install`.

Found `package-lock.json` instead of `yarn.lock`. Deleting `package-lock.json` and running `npm install`.

Executor has set Grotesk as the default font in `src/App.css`. Please manually test the application to verify the change.

Executor has added a link tag to `index.html` to load the Space Grotesk font, which was the reason it wasn't appearing on the UI. Please manually test the application again to verify that the Grotesk font is now applied.
